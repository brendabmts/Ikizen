    <string name="exp_ikigai">"In order to get your Ikigai, one begins by drawing the four circles. Once drawn, you have to fill in the fields of each circle that has no intersection with the others. The filling should look like this: - What do you love? \"What does the world need?\" \"What can you get paid for?\" \"What are you good at?\" Once this is done, the person discovers what they are: - their mission - their vocation - their profession - their passion. It is also up to the individual to fill in these four fields. Note that the intersections of 3 circles represent motives of dissatisfaction in life that people may have. In order to find fullness, they must consider the missing circle, giving rise to their Ikigai. "</string>
